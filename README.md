Banks play a crucial role in market economies. They decide who can get finance and on what terms and can make or break investment decisions. For markets and society to function, individuals and companies need access to credit. Credit scoring algorithms, which make a guess at the probability of default, are the method banks use to determine whether or not a loan should be granted. 

In this project I will be predicting the probability that someone will face a financial distress in the next two years. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can be used by borrowers to help make the best financial decisions.

I will be using a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
